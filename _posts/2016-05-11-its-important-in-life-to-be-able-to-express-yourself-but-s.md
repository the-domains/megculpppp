description: "It's important in life to be able to express yourself, but sometimes it's hard for us to have our voices heard. I have dealt with the fear of opening up about my thoughts out loud because I see others publicly speaking on their opinions and how it can offend and hurt people. But, I feel that it is import for EVERYONE to speak their mind, and we must change the way in which we go about expressing our thoughts and views. It's okay that someone else may not think the same as me. It's okay that I may not think the same as others. But what is also okay, is sharing ideas that may inspire and challenge others to view the world, life, and society from a different perspective. So here going nothing! Welcome to the life of Meg Culp, expressing myself through photography and unfiltered, in-depth thoughts on all things."
